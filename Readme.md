Model Architecture:
Input Layer: For image data (MRI scans).
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality.
Dense Layers: For classification.
Output Layer: Predict whether a tumor is present or not.
5.2 Relevance of the AI Model
Why CNN: CNNs are highly suitable for image processing and are widely used in medical imaging applications.
Performance Considerations: The chosen CNN model is optimized for medical image classification, with a strong focus on tumor detection.
6. AI Model Performance & Accuracy
6.1 Dataset Used
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images, such as the Brain MRI Images for Tumor Detection dataset from Kaggle.
Preprocessing Steps:
Resize images to a consistent size.
Normalize pixel values.
Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming.
6.2 Training Methodology
Hyperparameters:
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 50
Optimizer: Adam
Training Process:
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
The model is trained using the training set and validated on the validation set.
Regularization techniques like dropout are used to prevent overfitting.
6.3 Model Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive results in all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive results in all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: To evaluate the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
7. App Development & AI Model Integration
7.1 Core App Functionality
Upload Feature: The user can upload an MRI scan from their phone.
Image Preprocessing: The app sends the image to the backend, where it is preprocessed for AI model inference.
AI Model Output: The backend applies the trained model and returns whether a tumor is detected.
Results Display: The result is displayed to the user with a confidence score.
7.2 AI Model Integration
Flask/Django API: The AI model is deployed using a web framework (Flask or Django), exposing an API endpoint to the app. This allows the app to send MRI images and receive tumor detection results in real-time.
Image Upload: The app captures images from the mobile camera or allows users to upload existing MRI scans.
Prediction & Result Display: Once the AI model processes the image, the result (e.g., tumor detected or not) is displayed on the mobile screen.
